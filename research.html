            <h3>The Local Effects of Large-Scale Mining on Migration Patterns in Africa</h3>
            <p class="venue">CES Working Paper</p>
            <p style="text-align:justify;" class="abstract">This study investigates the effects of large-scale mining activities on migration patterns in administrative units at the communal level in Africa. The empirical strategy follows a difference-in-differences approach, leveraging exogenous variation in international commodity prices. The main dataset geo-matches information on net migration rates at the communal level with data on mineral deposits across all African countries. The results shows that a one percent price increase leads to an increase of 1.2 net migrants per 1,000 people in administrative units located within 20 km of a mineral deposit. I find that these effects are very localized and primarily driven by a reduction in outflows of people. While international migration likely plays a role, I show that changes should be primarily attributed to internal migration. Heterogeneity analysis further reveals that the effects of mining activity differ across African regions and are stronger in heavily urbanized areas. Economic activity is proposed as the main explanatory mechanism.</p>

            <h3>African Mining Economies and The Gender Gap in Political Participation </h3>
            <p class="venue">With A. Benshaul-Tolonen and M. Konte.</p>
			<p class="venue">SSRN Working Paper</p>
            <p style="text-align:justify;" class="abstract">There is a significant gender gap in political participation in Africa. Concurrently, many African economies are heavily reliant on traditionally male-dominated extractive industries. We investigate whether mining activities influence the gender gap in political participation at the local level using Afrobarometer data for 150,000 respondents with precise geo-located information on mining. The gender gap decreases across four dimensions of political participation in proximity of mining: the gap in discussing politics drops by 18.4\%, voting by 67\%, attending community meetings by 28\%, accepting women as leaders by 95\%. We detect no change in the gender gap in attending protests, although this gap does widen in high conflict areas. The results hold in a strictly exogenous identification strategy using international commodity prices, in areas with net inward, net outward, or net stable migration. We explore several mechanisms and find employment, but not community grievances or migration, to be a likely channel.</p>

            <p class="venue">Submitted to Regional Science and Urban Economics (Last Updated November 2024)</p>
            <p class="abstract">Using rich geospatial data and causal machine learning (ML), this paper maps potential economic benefits from incremental investments in all major types of public and economic infrastructure across Africa. These 'infrastructure potential maps' cover all African populated areas at a spatial resolution of 9.7km. They show that the local returns to infrastructure are highly variable and context-specific. For example 'hard infrastructure' such as paved roads and communications is more beneficial in cities, whereas 'social infrastructure' such as education, health, public services and utilities is more critical in rural areas. Market access and agglomeration forces largely govern these returns. The open <i>Africa Infrastructure Database</i> built for this project provides granular data classified into 54 economic categories. Its exploration further reveals that Africa's infrastructure is concentrated and often inefficiently allocated. All notable findings are consistent with economic literature, highlighting causal ML's ability to extract insights from geospatial data and assist spatial planning.</p>

            <h3>The Hustle Lifeways of Black Women in Mining-Affected Communities of South Africa </h3>
            <p class="venue">The Extractive Industries and Society, 2025</p>
            <p style="text-align:justify;" class="abstract">This study sets out to investigate the lived experiences of Black women living in South African communities affected by mining, specifically exploring how they navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by large-scale resource extraction. To do so, the study introduces the concept of “hustle lifeways”. In the context of mining-affected communities, this term captures how small-scale, often informal, income-generating activities are embodied in Black women's experiences of large-scale mining. Data is collected through a three-months fieldwork period across six mining-affected communities located in different provinces of South Africa. Thematic analysis highlights three key dimensions of hustle lifeways, namely survival, autonomy and caregiving responsibilities. The analysis of these three themes evidences Black women's resourcefulness, while underscoring the numerous challenges posed to them by large-scale mining, particularly in terms of exclusion, heightened uncertainty and increased care work. The insights from this analysis contribute to the literature on mining and women in South Africa, which has predominantly focused on women employed in the sector, by offering a new perspective on the gendered dimensions of large-scale mining.</p>

            <h3>Gold and Diamond Artisanal Mining in Liberia: Under the Umbrella of (in)Formality? </h3>
            <p class="venue">With R. Bazillier and S. Jackson.</p>
			<p class="venue">Resources Policy, 2023</p>
            <p style="text-align:justify;" class="abstract">Liberia intends to harness the development potential of artisanal mining through formalization. However, there are several obstacles that the country needs to overcome for it to succeed. The existing literature provides evidence on the challenges faced by miners and local authorities, but fails to make a distinction between different types of activities. This study sets out to identify differences in formalization patterns across the two largest artisanal sectors, namely gold and diamond mining. Drawing on an extensive survey of 231 communities and 174 mines in Gbarpolu County, we spatially match mining sites to their nearest license recorded in the country’s cadastre. To do so, we consider both distance to licenses and concentration of mines around titles before loosening the definition of formality by exploring town chiefs’ perceptions. We complement our spatial analysis with qualitative insights into miners’ views on the challenges and opportunities of artisanal gold versus diamond mining. Our findings show that artisanal diamond mines are more likely to fall under what we define as an “umbrella of formality” compared to gold mines. We explain this difference through geology, but also the history and perceptions of the respective minerals. Against this backdrop, we question the effectiveness of formalization as it is currently conceived in Liberia. We argue that distinguishing between artisanal mining sectors is important to understand the different sets of incentives and constraints that miners face. This, in turn, is key to the design of tailored and effective formalization policies.</p>
